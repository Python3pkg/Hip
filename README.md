# Hip

**H**uman **I**npu**t**

Guys please don't ask me: "Why should I use this?". The answer will always be: "I don't know sorry.". This data parser is more an experiment and will maybe be implemented into the ClanCatsFramework 2.1. If you guys are searching for a nice tested and approved data Serialization format use [YAML](http://yaml.org/).

If you still would like to try "HIP" out, feel free :)
